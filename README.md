# Face-Recognition-using-RaspberryPi
Biometrics is the science of using physiological or behavioral characteristics in order to verify the identity of an individual.
The most common forms of biometrics include fingerprints, voice-patterns, iris and retinal patterns, hand geometry, signature verification
and keystroke analysis. Face recognition is identification of humans by unique characteristics of the faces and is one of the several types
of existing biometrics systems. Face recognition is a passive, non-invasive method for verifying the identity of a person.
